abstract = {Abstract
Sequential Gaussian simulation method is taken as an example to analyze the characteristics and defects of stochastic simulation methods, and a modeling strategy is proposed that is based on the results of seismic inversion to improve modeling accuracy. Stochastic simulation can only achieve “mathematical reality” by recovery of parameter's macro statistical regularity through examples, and seismic forward model can verify whether the simulation results deviate from the “geological reality”. Seismic forward modeling can verify the reliability of the geological model, and the results of geological modeling constrained by seismic inversion can improve the accuracy of the model to achieve the “geological reality”. For braided river delta, a modeling strategy constrained by seismic inversion results in the condition of “multi-levels” and “multi-conditions” is put forward. For lithofacies modeling, division of lithofacies in single well acts as the first variable; in the stage of exploration and development, lithology probability and lithology body act as the second variable respectively, and then establish facies models. For property modeling, take lithofacies model and the seismic impedance as the first variable and the second variable respectively to create property model, in the condition of horizontal and vertical impedance constraints. The proposed modeling strategy maintains the statistical regularities of input data, keep a better consistency with seismic data, and match with dynamic field production.}

abstract = {A broad class of neural network (NN) applications dealing with the remote measurements of geophysical (physical, chemical, and biological) parameters of the oceans, atmosphere, and land surface is presented. In order to infer these parameters from remote sensing (RS) measurements, standard retrieval and variational techniques are applied. Both techniques require a data converter (transfer function or forward model) to convert satellite measurements into geophysical parameters or vice versa. In many cases, the transfer function and the forward model can be represented as a continuous nonlinear mapping. Because the NN technique is a generic technique for nonlinear mapping, it can be used beneficially for modeling transfer functions and forward models. These applications are introduced in a broader framework of solving forward and inverse problems in RS. In this broader context, we show that NN is an appropriate and efficient tool for solving forward and inverse problems in RS and for developing fast and accurate forward models and accurate and robust retrieval algorithms. Theoretical considerations are illustrated by several real-life examples—operational NN applications developed by the authors for SSM/I and medium resolution imaging spectrometer sensors.}

abstract = {There is a growing consensus that solutions to complex science and engineering problems require novel methodologies that are able to integrate traditional physics-based modeling approaches with state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques. This article provides a structured overview of such techniques. Application-centric objective areas for which these approaches have been applied are summarized, and then classes of methodologies used to construct physics-guided ML models and hybrid physics-ML frameworks are described. We then provide a taxonomy of these existing techniques, which uncovers knowledge gaps and potential crossovers of methods between disciplines that can serve as ideas for future research.},
